First Task:
-----------

1. Reflect on yesterday's "Even or Odd" problem.
2. Review:

    The Problem:
    How would you decide if a number is even or odd?
    Write down a step-by-step guide!

    Solution 1:
    Take a high number and count from 0 in steps of 2's. If the number in question will match one of the counted numbers, then the number in question will be even.

    Solution 2:
    Devide the number in question by 2 and if the remainder is the same as 0, then the number in question is a even number.

    Solution 3:
    Count on the natural numbers numberline and compare the number in question with every second number from the numberline. If the number in question matches one of the second numbers then it is a even number.

    Solution 4:
    Devide the number in question by two. If the result of the devision is the same as the integer value of the result, then it is a even number.

    Stefan's Step-by-Step Instructions (Solution 2):
    1. Ask for the number in questions (x).
    2. Devide the number x by two and check if there is a remainder.
    3. If there is not a remainder then x is even.
    4. If there is a remainder then x is odd.

3. Write down one Step-by-Step Instructions for any of the other solutions.


This is the Pseudocode that we came up with in class:
-----------------------------------------------------
```
INPUT number 
If number divided by 2 has a remainder THEN
    OUTPUT number is even
ELSE
    OUTPUT number is odd
``` 

This is how we used the Pseudocode to write Python:
---------------------------------------------------
```
# INPUT number
number = float(input('Enter a number'))
# If number divided by 2 has a remainder THEN
if number%2 == 0:
#   OUTPUT number is even
    print('number is even')
# ELSE
else:
#   OUTPUT number is odd
    print('number is odd')
```
