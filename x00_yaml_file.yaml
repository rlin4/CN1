# Our most preferred data file format is YAML
# YAML stands for Yet Another Markup Language
# YAML is great for us because:
# - It allows comments with the hash tag,
#   just as these comments at the beginning of this file
# - YAML has a similar 'format' to Python using indentation
# - More and more Linux configuration files are in YAML format
# - YAML can be read by many different applications and coding languages
# - We can validate our datafile copying/pasting into http://www.yamllint.com/
# - This tool will retain the comments:
#   https://www.json2yaml.com/convert-yaml-to-json (ignore the JSON bit for now)
