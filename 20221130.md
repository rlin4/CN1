Hi Class

Thank you Robert for checking this with me.

I got delayed chasing up a supply order for our class and mentioned 1pm to Ger by mistake. There is no class for CN1 at 13:00. Apologies for causing this confusion.

In the meantime, please validate your YAML file that you have uploaded to Moodle yesterday. Once it passes the validation continue on by uploading this file to your GitHub account.

I'll see you tomorrow and we will access your GitHub file with a Python script.

Thanks

Stefan

Hi Everyone

In addition to today's task, don't forget to post the link to your YAML file on GitHub as a reply to the version that you had posted on Moodle.

Thanks

Stefan
